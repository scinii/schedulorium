# Course Timetabling Optimization at the University of Groningen

This repository contains a model for solving the **Curriculum-Based Course Timetabling (CB-CTT)** problem at the **University of Groningen**. The main objective is to develop an optimized timetable for university courses, considering constraints such as lecturer schedules, room availability, student tracks, and course dependencies.

The model is designed to optimize the allocation of courses, lectures, tutorials, and labs to available rooms and timeslots. We use **AMPL** (A Mathematical Programming Language) as the optimization software to solve this timetabling problem, utilizing a combination of integer programming and constraint satisfaction techniques.

## Problem Overview

At the University of Groningen, students are enrolled in one of three main tracks:
- **Applied Mathematics**
- **General Mathematics**
- **Probability and Statistics**

Students in these tracks follow a curriculum where certain courses are mandatory for specific years or specializations. The **Curriculum-Based Timetabling (CB-CTT)** system aims to create a timetable that avoids scheduling conflicts between courses, tutorials, and labs, while also meeting the needs of the lecturers and available rooms.

### Key Features:
- **Track-based scheduling**: Courses are assigned based on tracks (Applied Mathematics, General Mathematics, Probability and Statistics).
- **Room and timeslot optimization**: Ensures that each event is scheduled in an appropriate room and timeslot, avoiding overlaps.
- **Lecturer assignments**: Lecturers are assigned to the courses they are supposed to teach, ensuring no conflicts in their schedules.
- **Block-based scheduling**: The academic year is divided into four blocks, each requiring specific scheduling considerations.

### Sub-objectives to Optimize:
1. **Minimize the number of events scheduled in the late timeslot (17:00â€“19:00)**: Evening slots are less desirable for both students and lecturers.
2. **Minimize unused room capacity**: Avoids wasting room space, ensuring rooms are used efficiently.
3. **Minimize the number of rooms used**: Aims to reduce the overall number of rooms required, optimizing the use of available spaces.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:

Before using the model, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for the model implementation.
- **AMPL**: The optimization software used for solving the timetabling problem.
- **Required Python libraries**: Libraries for data handling and visualization.

To install the necessary Python libraries, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Additionally, you need to have **AMPL** installed on your system. You can download it from [AMPL's official website](https://ampl.com/).

### Data Input:

The model requires input data in the form of Excel files, which should be placed in the `data/` directory. These files contain:
1. **Courses Data**: Information about courses, their associated tracks, and the events that need to be scheduled (lectures, tutorials, labs).
2. **Room Data**: Details of the rooms available for scheduling, including capacity and type (lecture halls, computer labs, etc.).

The data files should be structured as follows:
- **Courses Excel file**: Contains columns like course name, track, number of students, event type, and timing preferences.
- **Rooms Excel file**: Contains information such as room name, capacity, and room type (e.g., lecture, computer lab).


A visual output of the end result is shown below where:

* Orange --> Lectures
* Blue   --> Tutorials
* Purple --> Computer Labs
