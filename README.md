# IP model for Timetabeling

This code accompanies my Bachelor Thesis which focus is
on integer programming modeling for the University Course Timetabeling problem.

The problem is solved using AMPL (in particular the HiGHS solver)
and its python API.

Further details can be found in the thesis itself
